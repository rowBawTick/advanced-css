These notes are not complete (only important notes or new knowledge from my POV)

3 pillars of maintainable HTML & CSS:
    - See image
    - Most performance improvements can be made by reducing image sizes
    (or just use less images - ask yourself if they are necessary)

Loading a Webpage:
    - Parsing html decodes the html and then creates the DOM.
    - Parsing the html also includes parsing CSS.
    Parsing CSS:
        - Process final CSS values - calculate CSS values using the CSS (e.g. 50%) and the
        user's device -> convert it into pixels.
        -  CSS Object Model (CSSOM) - similar to DOM.

Specificity:
    - Always put your stylesheets last after 3rd party stylesheets!
    - Not from the course, but max specificity should be 1.
    - TailwindCSS & BEM are good solutions to conflicting CSS (also scoped CSS in Vue components)
